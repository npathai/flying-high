# flying-high
My rendition of https://github.com/wakaleo/flying-high, a web application that provides airline booking service. The service has been created with Outside-In testing using Behavior Driven Development methodology.

The goal of creating this pet project is to learn various technologies in different spaces.

Technologies/Frameworks/Libraries used:

## Behavior Driven Development/End to End Testing/Acceptance Testing
> Do Agile software development as it was meant to be done!

### Thucydidies/Serenity
Serenity is an open source library that helps you write higher quality automated acceptance tests faster.

## Web Services Integration & Unit tests

### Spring Boot Integration Test
Integration testing of Spring boot web service

### Spock Unit Test
Why not take unit testing at a new level with Spock, a testing library written in Groovy. What makes it stand out from the crowd is its beautiful and highly expressive specification language. Given, When, Then flow.

## Web Services

### Spring Boot
Takes an opinionated view of building production-ready Spring applications. Spring Boot favors convention over configuration and is designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible.

## Database

### MongoDB
A fun NoSQL database with JSON and Javascript in data tier.

## Dependency management

### NPM for web application
npm is the package manager for JavaScript and the world’s largest software registry. Discover packages of reusable code — and assemble them in powerful new ways.

### Maven for Acceptance tesing & Spring Web Services
I so thought of using gradle but already I was boggled with so many new technologies that I preferred not to :)
Visit: https://maven.apache.org/

Well that is it for now!
